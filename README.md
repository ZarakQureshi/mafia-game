# mafia-game

This has been developed using Visual Studio Code.

First you must install the newest available version of node.
This can be viewed by typing: node -v 
into terminal you can view your current version of the npm module. 
We have used 6.14.4.

We install the required dependencies by typing the following into terminal:
npm i socket.io
npm i --save-dev nodemon
npm i express ejs

Socket.io will help us connect to the server used, nodemon will help visual studio autosave the server and ejs is used as a document type similar to html.
